# Portal Do Malte

It's a beer e-commerce.
I always wanted to create a project by myself, based on the content acquired in courses,
as Portal do Malte I am putting Front-end and Back-end concepts into practice, in addition to the Database concept and good programming practices.

## Technologies Used

 > Front-end ---> React
 > Back-End ---> Java & Spring boot
 > Banco de Dados ---> MySQL
