# Portal Do Malte

<p>It's a beer e-commerce.</p><br />
<p>I always wanted to create a project by myself, based on the content acquired in courses,</br></p>
<p>as Portal do Malte I am putting Front-end and Back-end concepts into practice, in addition to the Database concept and good programming practices.</p>

## Technologies Used

 > <p>Front-end ---> React<br /></p>
 > <p>Back-End ---> Java & Spring boot<br /></p>
